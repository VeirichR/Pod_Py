# Pod_Py
I made this project to make easy to find all episodes not played from my favorite shows.

I used the SPOTIPY and SELENIUM to make this project.

SPOTIPY was used to create a new playlist and get all the episodes from my shows, i could't find a way to check if the episode was played or not so i use SELENIUM to get all the episodes and save the played ones. With that information i took them off the new episodes list and finally populate the new playlist with SPOTIPY. I also used logs to check all the episodes and errors, first time using it too. :D
